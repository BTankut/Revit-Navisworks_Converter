# CLAUDE.md - RVT to Navisworks Converter

## Overview
This is a WPF desktop application built with .NET Framework 4.8 that facilitates downloading Revit (.rvt) files from a Revit Server and converting them to Navisworks formats (.nwd/.nwc). The application follows MVVM architecture pattern with dependency injection and Material Design UI components.

## Architecture & Patterns

### Core Architecture
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with strict separation of concerns
- **Framework**: WPF with .NET Framework 4.8, C# 8.0 language features
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for service registration and resolution
- **UI Framework**: Material Design in XAML for modern UI components
- **Data Binding**: Two-way data binding with INotifyPropertyChanged implementation

### Key Design Decisions
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Business logic encapsulated in injectable services with interfaces
- **Command Pattern**: RelayCommand implementation for UI actions
- **Async/Await**: Extensive use of asynchronous operations for file I/O and network calls
- **Event-Driven Updates**: PropertyChanged events and custom events for UI synchronization

## Key Business Workflows

### Application Startup
1. **DI Container Setup** (App.xaml.cs): Register all services, ViewModels, and Views
2. **Permission Validation** (MainWindow): Check file system permissions on load
3. **Settings Loading** (SettingsService): Load configuration from appsettings.json
4. **UI Initialization** (MainViewModel): Initialize file system browsing state

### File System Operations
1. **Server Connection**: Connect to Revit Server using configured IP and credentials
2. **Local Browsing**: Navigate local file system for existing .rvt files
3. **Version Detection**: Automatic Revit version detection from server paths, filenames, and file content
4. **Selection Management**: Hierarchical selection state (parent/child folder relationships)
5. **Batch Processing**: Queue files for download and/or conversion operations

### External Tool Integration
- **Revit Server Tool**: `RevitServerTool.exe` for server communication and file download
- **Navisworks Tool**: `FileToolsTaskRunner.exe` for .rvt to .nwd/.nwc conversion
- **PowerShell Execution**: All external tools executed via PowerShell with comprehensive logging
- **Tool Version Management**: Support for multiple tool versions with automatic detection

### Key Features (v1.8.0)
1. **Automatic Tool Detection**
   - Scans Program Files for installed Revit/Navisworks versions
   - Dropdown selection for available tool versions
   - Persists tool selections in settings

2. **Revit Version Detection**
   - Server path parsing (e.g., `\Revit Server 2021\`)
   - Filename pattern matching (e.g., `R21` â†’ `2021`)
   - File content analysis for version strings
   - Real-time version display in UI

3. **Version Compatibility Checking**
   - Pre-process validation of file/tool version matching
   - Warning dialog for incompatible versions
   - User override option for compatibility warnings

## Configuration Management

### Settings Architecture
- **Storage**: JSON-based configuration in `appsettings.json`
- **Validation**: Real-time IP ping validation and path existence checking
- **UI Feedback**: Live validation status with color-coded indicators
- **Persistence**: Automatic save on settings changes

### Key Configuration Points
```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "RevitServerIp": "Server IP address",
    "RevitServerAccelerator": "Accelerator IP/hostname", 
    "RevitServerToolPath": "Path to RevitServerTool.exe",

- **External Tool Safety**: PowerShell execution with controlled parameter passing
- **Licensing System**: RSA-2048 asymmetric encryption for license signatures
  - Hardware ID generation from system identifiers
  - License validation only in Release builds
  - Automatic import of `.lic` files from app directory or `%AppData%`
  - Secure storage in `%LocalAppData%` with registry backup

## Working with This Codebase

### Adding New Features
1. **Services**: Create interface in `/Services/` and implement with DI registration
2. **UI Components**: Follow MVVM pattern with ViewModels in `/ViewModels/`
3. **Models**: Add data classes in `/Models/` with INotifyPropertyChanged if needed
4. **Validation**: Extend ValidationService for new input validation requirements

### Testing Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Run application and test workflows end-to-end
- **Configuration Testing**: Verify settings persistence and validation
- **External Tool Integration**: Test with actual Revit Server and Navisworks installations

### Common Modification Patterns
- **New File Types**: Extend IFileSystemItem interface and service implementations
- **Additional Servers**: Abstract server communication interfaces
- **UI Enhancements**: Leverage Material Design components and MVVM data binding
- **Logging Extensions**: Extend FileLogger for additional log categories

### Dependencies for Development
- **Visual Studio 2019+** or **VS Code** with C# extension
- **Autodesk Revit Server** (for server functionality testing)
- **Autodesk Navisworks Manage** (for conversion functionality testing)
- **.NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Issues
- Ensure .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack is installed
- Check NuGet package restoration
- Verify MaterialDesignThemes package compatibility

### Runtime Issues
- Check `appsettings.json` configuration completeness
- Validate file system permissions (run as administrator if needed)
- Ensure external tools (RevitServerTool.exe, FileToolsTaskRunner.exe) are accessible
- Review `app_log.txt` for detailed error information

### Performance Issues
- Monitor file system access patterns for large directory structures
- Check network connectivity for server operations
- Review PowerShell execution logs for external tool performance
